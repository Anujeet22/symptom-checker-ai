# Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker

## Overview
The **Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker** is an innovative AI-powered solution designed to analyze user-reported symptoms and provide potential health insights.  
Developed entirely using **IBM Cloud** and **Watsonx.ai** in a no-code environment, this project demonstrates the power of **agentic AI** in the healthcare domain, where an AI agent can autonomously process inputs, make decisions, and deliver meaningful guidance to users.

The system is aimed at making health information **accessible**, **quick**, and **user-friendly** â€” especially for individuals in remote or underserved areas.
